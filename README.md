# Employee survey api

This project was developed using java 8 and spring boot 2.7.6. The idea of this project to communicate with the mysql database and share data. Currently we have only one api method to submit the survey results. CORS enabled in backend to access only the particular url. Migration is included so when we start the application the tables are created automatically.

You can download this project and go to main class, right click there will be an option to Run 'ProjectName'
